"""ArtifactManager — the final task summary (§14).

The artifact reports, never re-derives: `status` is exactly `state.outcome`, and
the rest is read off `TaskState` plus the workspace diff (the deliverable — the
harness never commits, §15). Keeping `status` a copy of `outcome` is what lets a
caller distinguish "give me more budget" (`incomplete`) from "this can't be
verified" (`failed`) from "I need input" (`blocked`).
